						About Me
					</h2>
					<p>
						Hello! My name is Tom Tran and I am currently in my final year
						of computer science at the University of Alberta in Edmonton,
						Canada. I started off my university career in electrical
						engineering back in 2005, hoping that one day I could help
						society advance technology. However, during my final year in
						electrical engineering when I worked on my capstone project,
						I had to learn C programming in order to develop the firmware
						for my piece of software. It was during this time that I
						developed a very deep interest for computer programming. I
						absolutely enjoy the challenges and problem solving required
						when programming. Moreover, I feel that the field of computer science is
						very broad and dynamic. Thus, there are various ways that I can
						pursue my goal of contributing to the advancement of technology.

					<h2>
						My Professional History
					</h2>
					<p>
						I have worked at IBM as an intern for 20 months from January 2012
						to August 2013. During this internship, I was on a performance team called System
						Optimization Competency Centre. The purpose of this team was to
						optimize the cross-functionality between IBM's hardware and software
						products. Due to the nature of the projects on this team, I
						had the opportunity to work with many exciting, cutting-edge technologies.
						For example, I worked with:
						<br />
						<ul>
							<li>
								IBM Watson (from Jeopardy!)
							</li>
							<li>
								IBM POWER multiprocessor
							</li>
							<li>
								IBM Infosphere Streams
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<br />
						In addition to working with a wide variety of technologies,
						I had the opportunity to work with a broad range of computer
						science fields such as:
						<br />
						<ul>
							<li>
								Virtualization
							</li>
							<li>
								Big Data
							</li>
							<li>
								Software Profiling (C/C++)
							</li>
							<li>
								Storage Systems
							</li>
							<li>
								Hardware Accelerators
							</li>
							<li>
								Networking
							</li>
							<li>
								Unix Environment/Shell Scripting
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<br />
						Besides the technical experience I have mentioned above, I also
						gain many soft skills such as:
						<br />
						<ul>
							<li>
								Communication
							</li>
							<li>
								Presentation
							</li>
							<li>
								Organization
							</li>

					<h2>
						My Offerings
					</h2>
					<p>
						I have worked extensively in a UNIX-like environment and have
						a solid foundation with object-oriented programming through
						my previous work experience as well as my multiple academic
						projects. My ability to learn and adapt quickly as well as
						my time management skills have proven to be extremely strong
						assets, especially when multitasking. Moreover, my enthusiasm
						and collaboration skills have consistently allowed me to clearly
						and confidently communicate with colleagues.
					<br />
						I few technical languages I know are:
						<ul>
							<li>
								C
							</li>
							<li>
								C++
							</li>
							<li>
								Java
							</li>
							<li>
