Modification by Tom Tran
========================

Part 1:

Body -  I have changed the body to have a light teal background. I have set 
        margins/paddings on the left and right side of the page as well as drawn
        solid black borders along the sides to make the html page look more like
        a notebook page. I have set the minimum width of the body(page) to be 
        500px.
        
Headers - I have set all headers (h1-h6) to be centered and have a gold color.

Image - Only one of my documents have images (Huckleberry Finn) and I have set
        the images to be centered with a solid black border around it.
        
Image Captions - Unfortunately there are not image captions in my three chosen 
                 documents, but if there were, image captions would be centered 
                 with a bolder font. In addition, the captions would have a 
                 black border around it.

Paragraphs - I have set the font of paragraphs to be Source Sans Pro',
             sans-serif. Additionally, I have set the font weight and line 
             height to 150%.
